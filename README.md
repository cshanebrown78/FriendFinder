# FriendFinder

## Overview

This is a Friend Finder App using node express.  It is the 13th assignment for my bootcamp class.  The app has a user enter their name and a link to an image of them and then has them answer some questions based on a value from 1 - 5.  Once these are submitted it compares the scores to that of people in the system and matches the one with the closest score displaying that person in a modal.

## Steps to complete in order to use App

1. Clone repository

2. Install required node packages by using npm install command in the terminal.
